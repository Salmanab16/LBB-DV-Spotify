# LBB-DV-Spotify
I made this project to complete my task in data visualization specialization by Algoritma Data Science School. I use spotify database from Kaggle. In here, I visualize music taste preference in decades, top songs 2020 and music genre by its popularity.

I used 2 dataset which one of it already provided in the file and the other one you can found it in https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ektanegi/spotifydata-19212020

Thankyou, hope it helps!
